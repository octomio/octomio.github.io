    <h1>Thank You, CT</h1>
    <p>Thank you for being yourself and putting your ideas into the world — whether people liked them or not. I want to sincerely apologize for taking your artwork and making it the core of this site without asking for permission or even trying. I was too shy, a coward, and I recognize that this letter doesn’t excuse that.</p>
    <p>This thank you note does not free me from guilt. I created this because I admire your work and wanted to carry it with me on all my devices. I’m a quiet supporter, and I no longer want to stay silent. I would love to support you financially — I even went to see you at your first convention in a long time and got an art book signed. I’d give so much more if I could.</p>
    <p>I wish you nothing but the best — through every challenge and beyond. You deserve it. And if you ever do see this, I will gladly take the site down if that’s your wish.</p>
