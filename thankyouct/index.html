    <h1>A Personal Thank You to CT</h1>
    <p>Thank you — not just for your artwork, but for being yourself and for putting your ideas into the world, regardless of how people might receive them. It’s that honesty and bravery that made your work stand out to me in the first place.</p>
    <p>I also want to sincerely apologize. The purpose of this site revolves around a piece of your artwork, and I never asked for permission. I didn’t even try. That was cowardly of me. I used your work without reaching out — not because I wanted to disrespect it, but because I was too shy, too afraid to say something stupid or embarrassing. That fear doesn’t excuse what I did, and this message isn’t meant to free me of guilt. It’s just the truth.</p>
    <p>I apologize for any and all use of your work here. This note might be the only way I know how to speak up. I’m usually a quiet supporter — the kind that admires from afar — but I can’t stay silent about how much your work has meant to me.</p>
    <p>When you made your first convention appearance in years, I went. Not because I wanted to bother you, but because I wanted to support you in the one way I could without words. If there were ever an official way to support or purchase your art, I’d do it in a heartbeat. I just wish I could.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I wish you the best — with your art, with your career, and with whatever life puts in your path. You deserve nothing less.</p>
    <p>If you ever see this site and want it taken down, I’ll do it without hesitation.</p>
    <p>From one quiet admirer,<br/>Thank you.</p>
