    <h1>Thank You, CT</h1>
    <p>
      I don't know if you'll ever see this.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site was built because one image—<em>your image</em>—stayed with me.  
      I never asked for permission, and for that, I'm sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't about stealing. I'm not making money.  
      I'm not trying to go viral. I just wanted to honor something that made me feel something.  
      Like a time capsule. Like a tribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want this site taken down, I will take it down. No questions.  
      But if you do see this... thank you. For Annie Chan, for the inspiration,  
      and for sharing your gift—even once.
